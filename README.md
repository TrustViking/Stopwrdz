# Swords

## Description

Swords is a command-line tool developed to replace prohibited stop words in video titles, specifically tailored for compliance with TikTok's guidelines. 


The international project "Creative Society" was initiated by people around the world.

Consumerism dominates in today’s society, and we all see that it has played itself out, which is leading humankind into a dead-end. On May 11, 2019, at the global online conference “SOCIETY. THE LAST CHANCE”, people raised this issue and expressed a common opinion that building a new creative society is a vital necessity. The unique format of the conference inspired people to take action because they were able to express their sincere opinion and take responsibility for their own lives and our common future.

At this stage, we set out the goal of finding out from people around the world whether they want to live in the Creative Society as well as of informing the public about this possibility. 

Here https://youtube.com/@creative_society?si=KJJk7kiwKR_133Ak you will find videos produced by people from more than 180 countries around the world.
